# Project details 
The "Bangla-Offensive-Text-Identifying-from social media posts using-deep-learning" project is an advanced initiative aimed at identifying offensive or harmful text within social media posts written in the Bengali (Bangla) language. Leveraging the power of deep learning, this project employs various state-of-the-art BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) transformer models, including mBERT, DistilBERT, Bangla BERT, XLM-RoBERTa Base, and XLM-RoBERTa Large, to effectively analyze and classify text data.
We have collected a dataset from BRAC UNIVERSITY which contains a total of 44,000 data. To ensure the model's accuracy and effectiveness, The dataset of 20,000 social media posts and comments in Bengali was carefully curated. In particular, the dataset was manually sorted to identify and label instances of threatening or offensive content. This manual labeling process plays a crucial role in training and fine-tuning the deep learning models to recognize offensive text accurately.
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a robust and precise system for automatically detecting and categorizing offensive language and threats in Bengali social media posts. Such a tool can be instrumental in promoting a safer and more respectful online environment, aiding content moderation efforts, and ensuring the well-being of Bengali-speaking social media users.
